critical path order of steps:
===================

1. Begin constructing the Dom by parsing HTML
2. Request CSS & JS resources (but it's syncronouse - can't execute it until having cssom)
3. Parse CSS and construct CSSOM tree
4. Execute JS
5. Merge DOM and CSSOM into the render tree

to build the render tree you need both the dom and cssom tree so we must load css first before rendering,
Javascript is blocked until cssom is created. Once js is executed, dom parser is unblocked and can render page

how to optimize?
===================

-inlince critical css
-inline critical js
-add media query type to css (to skip dounload if not needed)
-async js that doesn't affect the dom

-reduce number of bytes to download
-reduce number of critical resources
-reduce critical path length

above the fold css steps:
===================

-Determine the above-the-fold styles for a page and write them between <style> tags in the head.
-Load all other stylesheets in the footer, ideally asynchronously.
