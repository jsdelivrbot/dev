change ownership of file:
chown user:user file
chown annettewestdrape:annettewestdrape file.txt
chown annettewestdrape:annettewestdrape wp-activate.php

change ownership of entire folder:
chown -R annettewestdrape:annettewestdrape public_html/

below is the correct ownership for public_html folder:
chown -R annettewestdrape:nobody public_html/
(theusername:nobody)

list permissions for a file:
ls -l index.php

File access permissions appear in the first column of the output i.e. -rw-r--r--

    The first character - is nothing but the file type. Ã± means regular file and d means directory.
    The next three characters (rw-) specify permissions for the user who owns the file
    The next three (r--) specify permissions for all members of the group that owns the file.
    Finally, the last three characters in the column (r--) specify permissions for all other users on the system.

Each character in permission has meaning as follows:

    r : Read permission.
    w : Write permission.
    x : Execute permission.
    - : No permission.

For example rw- permission means owner can read, write to a file but cannot execute the same.

change file permissions:
chmod 755 index.php


For wordpress, change file permissions to proper format recursively with the following command:

For Directories:
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
For Files:
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
