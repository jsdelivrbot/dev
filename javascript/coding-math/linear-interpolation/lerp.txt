linear interpolation is the opposite of normalize.
You have the value from zero to one and you want to find
out the range version value (value between min and max numbers)


max - min just gets the range since we're not only working with a range from zero to whatever.
the base of the formula is norm times the range.
we are then left with the number that lies within that range but it just gives you the number starting from the min.
We need to add the min value to offset it to the correct starting position.
(max - min) * norm + min
