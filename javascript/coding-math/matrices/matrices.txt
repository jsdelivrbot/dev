good article on matrices:
http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/

need (x,y,z,w) vectors to work with matrices.
Difference between direction and position vectors:
If w == 1, then the vector (x,y,z,1) is a position in space.
If w == 0, then the vector (x,y,z,0) is a direction.
