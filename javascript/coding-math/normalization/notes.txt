normalization is converting a range in to a value that lies between zero and one.
Like a percentage of a that range. The minus min just takes it back to a simple formula of
value/max - this would be the as if the range was zero to max.

formula:
(val - min) / (max - min)

		min       val    max
0------15--------44-----55
