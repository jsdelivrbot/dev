good design rules for module pattern:

-self contained module
	-everything to do with the module is in the module
	-no global variables
	-if managing more than one thing, it should be split up
-separation of concerns
-DRY code (don’t repeat yourself)
-efficient DOM usage
	-very few $(‘selector’) uses (dom caching)
-no memory leaks
	-all events can be unbound
	(if you don’t unbind events, the event listener will stay in memory,
	this is a problem for large single page apps where the page doesn’t refresh)
