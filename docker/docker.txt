general info
----------------------

docker default machine ip:
192.168.99.100
(get this through: docker-machine ip MACHINE_VM)

access it on windows:
/c/Users/benja

cleanup:
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a)
docker rmi -f $(docker images)

----------------------
docker hub
----------------------

https://hub.docker.com/?utm_source=getting_starteGd_guide&utm_medium=embedded_Windows&utm_campaign=create_docker_hub_account
login to dockerhub:
docker login --username=yourhubusername
docker login --username=ben95

----------------------
containers 
(copy from images then build ontop and commit to new images)
----------------------

list your containers:
docker ps [-a include stopped containers, -q only ids, 
-l container that was run last, -f forces removal even if it's in use]

remove container:
(-f to force operation)
docker rm -f [OPTIONS] [CONTAINER]
docker rm -f docker-wordpress-nginx

stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

remove all containers
(get the result of docker ps -a and pass as an arg to docker rm)
(-f to force operation)
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a)

start a container:
docker start <name | id>
docker start docker-wordpress-nginx

starts a container from an image (and downloads it if not installed already).
Note that every time you call this it creates a new container 
from that image so you can make multiple ones running this command again. 
-d runs in background (detached mode)
-p maps the ports <docker-daemon-port>:<host-port>
-it runs interactive mode (puts your right into the container root user terminal to build the
container that way instead of using a dockerfile)
docker run <image>
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginxcontainer ben95/nginx:v1

run multiple containers from one image (perhaps for load balancing):
docker run -d --name web1 -p 8081:80 tutum/hello-world
docker run -d --name web2 -p 8082:80 tutum/hello-world
docker run -d --name web3 -p 8083:80 tutum/hello-world

take a look at backgrond processes running:
docker logs <id>

exit out of a foreground running container:
exit

compare changes from current container to base image
(in the output - A specifies we've added things)
docker diff <id>

stop a container (will stop a background container, use docker kill for harsher termination):
docker stop <name | id>

change docker tag(name) of committed images:
docker tag [img id] [docker-username]/[image-name]:[version-label-or-tagname]
exaple:
docker tag 0a69b6164346 ben95/docker-whale:v1

commit container to image
(creates a new layer and a new image from a container)
docker commit [img id] [docker-username]/[image-name]:[version-label-or-tagname]
docker commit
or
docker commit 0a69b6164346 ben95/docker-whale:v1

push container to dockerhub
login, then:
docker push [docker-username]/[image-name]
docker push ben95/docker-whale


----------------------
port mapping containers
(use these for mapping your container to hosts or other containers)
----------------------

find the port number of the container:
docker port <id-of-container>

docker ps also shows the host/container port number

find the private ip address of a container (shouldn't really have to use this)
docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <ContainerID>

lets set up redis to demonstrate communication
docker pull redis

start up redis server container from redis image
docker run -d --name redisserver redis

run another container to link to the redis server container
--link <server-container-name:alias-for-link>
docker run -it --name redisclient1 --link redisserver:redis redis sh
cat /etc/hosts
you'll see:
172.17.0.3      redis 58048cafe11b redisserver
ping using alias name for that connection:
ping redis
connect to the other container using redis client:
redis-cli -h redis
ping
returns:
PONG
set myname Ben
set mycountry Canada
get myname
Ben
get mycountry
Canada

run another container in new terminal (redisclient2):
docker run -it --name redisclient2 --link redisserver:redis redis sh
redis-cli -h redis
get myname
Ben

in new terminal:
docker ps

----------------------
images 
(read-only templates that you copy from to create containers - like instances)
----------------------

note:
when inserting image IDs in commands, 
you can just put in the first three numbers for a shortcut

list images:
docker images
list all images used by images too
docker images -a
list including all images built to use an image (all RUN commands)
These are the layers of the onion
docker history

remove image (-f to force operation):
docker rmi -f [image-id-or-name]
docker rmi -f ben95/docker-whale:v1

remove all images
(get the result of docker ps -a and pass as an arg to docker rm)
(-f to force operation)
docker rmi -f $(docker images)

search for docker images:
docker search <image-name>

download an image without running a container from it
<imagename:version>
docker pull <image>

----------------------
dockerfiles
----------------------

commands:

FROM [docker-image]
RUN [commands to run - each command is a layer in the image?]
EXPOSE [listener port for docher daemon for what it will connect to]
CMD [can appear on any line in docker file you can only use this once in a dockerfile (or the last one will be used)
it runs the default command in the terminal when you build your container if no user command is run]
ENTRYPOINT [CMD gets the user input then inserts it into the entrypoint base command ]

example:

FROM ubuntu:12.04
MAINTAINER Joe Shmoe "jshmoe@domain.com"
RUN echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main universe" > /etc/apt/sources.list
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx"]


------
instructions (RUN, CMD and ENTRYPOINT) can be specified in shell form or exec form

shell form:
<instruction> <command>
RUN apt-get install python3  
CMD echo "Hello world"  
ENTRYPOINT echo "Hello world"  

exec form:
<instruction> ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...]
RUN ["apt-get", "install", "python3"]  
CMD ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]  
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]  

------

build image from dockerfile
dockerfile notes:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/
(the . at the end is the build context - our current directory)
-t is the tag for our image
docker build -t youruser/sinatra:v2 .
docker build -t youruser/sinatra:v2 .

docker history
lists out all the RUN commands the image was built from
docker history <imagename>

----------------------
volumes
----------------------

to a run a container and set a volume to share with host:
use the path to the current directory on the host (my computer)
("$PWD" is the current dir)
-v <hostdir>:<container-dir>:rw
rw "read-write", so the container can write to the directory
this creates a "site" folder in our current directory when run.
Use this dir to store your files/data through your machine:
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v "$PWD"/site:/www --name mywww nginxserver

or this is the same as:
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /dockerfiles/docker_nginx/site:/www --name mywww nginxserver


--------------------------------
share volumes between containers
--------------------------------
advantages:
-share data between containers
-preserve changes to files (creating files in interactive mode are not recorded into comitted containers)
-writing become much faster because we bypass the copy on write technique docker uses
because we're using the system's write method
-even if the host container for the volume isn't running, the volume can still be accessed from other containers


create a volume inside the base image like ubuntu for example:
docker run -it --name alpha -v /var/myvolume ubuntu
ls /var/myvolume/
echo "Hello World" > /var/myvolume/myfile.txt
cat /var/myvolume/myfile.txt
Hello World

in a new tab, run a new container
and use the volume from the other one:
docker run -it --name beta --volumes-from alpha ubuntu
ls /var/myvolume/
echo "Hi" >> /var/myvolume/myfile.txt
cat /var/myvolume/myfile.txt
Hello World
Hi

test accessing the volume when volume container isn't running.
in original tab:
exit

then into the other tab again:
echo "Another line" >> /var/myvolume/myfile.txt
cat /var/myvolume/myfile.txt
Hello World
Hi
Another line

get some information about the containers
(pipe it to less to look at json file)
docker inspect alpha | less
search for mounts:
/"Mounts"
you'll see
"Destination": "/var/myvolume",

----------------------
docker compose
----------------------

list of commands:
https://docs.docker.com/v1.5/compose/cli/

run this, in your proj directory:
docker-compose up

or detached mode to run in background:
docker-compose up -d

see what's currently running:
docker-compose ps

to run one of the existing services in interactive mode
you can find the service name using 
docker-compose ps 
then:
docker-compose run <service-name>
(but interactive mode isn't yet supported on windows)

to run bash in a compose container:
workaround:
docker exec -i -t <service-name> bash
docker exec -i -t dockernodenginx_postgres_1 bash

stop the services if you startd them with -d
docker-compose stop

to restart
docker-compose restart

interactive bash into one service
docker exec -it <full-service-name>
docker exec -it dockerlempdev_nginx_1 bash

ping to test it's connections:
ping <service-name>
ping php

----------------------
publishing docker compose for production
----------------------

when ready for production, make sure to use a copy of your compose file ready for production
see info here:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f production.yml up -d

When you make changes to your app code, you’ll need to rebuild your image and recreate your app’s containers. 
To redeploy a service called web, you would use the below.
This will first rebuild the image for web and then stop, destroy, and recreate just the web service. 
The --no-deps flag prevents Compose from also recreating any services which web depends on.
$ docker-compose build web
$ docker-compose up --no-deps -d web

misc.
----------------------

when installing docker careful of security issues:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ZsdV0I4kE#t=56.047005

list commands just type:
docker

debugging - get some information about a container/image
(pipe it to less to look at json file)
docker inspect container-or-image-name | less

when doing local dev use live-server (while in docker directory)
live-server
video here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q78u9lBXvj0

install busybox:
It's a lightweight image - when running a container off that image, when you pass it a command it executes that command
for you.

docker run busybox echo Hello


----------------------
troubleshooting
----------------------
if docker has trouble connecting:

delete all virtual machines in virtualbox (yes to delete vm files)

or try:

docker-machine restart default      # Restart the environment
eval $(docker-machine env default)  # Refresh your environment settings

or
service docker restart

stop your Docker Machine and restart it:
docker-machine restart node-nginx3
eval $(docker-machine env node-nginx3)

to destroy all containers/images:
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a)
docker rmi -f $(docker images)

# Delete all stopped containers
docker ps -q -f status=exited | xargs --no-run-if-empty docker rm
# Delete all dangling (unused) images
docker images -q -f dangling=true | xargs --no-run-if-empty docker rmi

# to stop the machine:
docker-machine stop node-nginx3
# remove droplet:
# If this also produces errors, you can always delete the
# Droplet using the Digitalocean web console as a fallback.
docker-machine rm -f node-nginx

stop all docker machines:
docker-machine stop
note - to run a script on postgress on startup:
remove docker machine
docker-machine rm -f wordpress-machine

init.sql script:
CREATE USER docker;
CREATE DATABASE docker;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE docker TO docker;

dockerfile:
FROM library/postgres
ADD init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
