origin 
———————
is not the remote repository name. It is rather a local alias set as a key for the remote repository URL.
It avoids the user having to type the whole remote URL when prompting a push.
This name is set by default and for convention by git when cloning from a remote for the first time.
This alias name is not hard coded and could be changed using following command prompt :
git remote rename origin mynewalias

remote

A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server. You can only push to two types of URL addresses: An HTTPS URL like https://github.com/user/repo.git.
