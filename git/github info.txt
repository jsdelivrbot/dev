commands
-----------------------------
-----------------------------

origin/remote
——————————————
#(origin is the default remote name Git gives to the server you cloned from)

#list all remotes
# -v (verbose) shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname (origin)
to be used when reading and writing to that remote
git remote -v

#add origin (specify the default remote):
git remote add origin <origin>

#remove origin
git remote rm origin

#to inspect a remote
git remote show <remotename>
#for example:
git remote show origin

init and clone
—————————————————————

# init for new repo files in filesystem
git init

# pull your reprository into the current  using the repo url:
git clone repositoryurl

# to pull a specific commit:
git checkout 91f25642453


staging
———————————————
# adds the locally included file to the remote repo
git add yournewfile.js
# stage All
git add -A
# stage new and modified, without deleted
git add . 
# stage modified and deleted, without new
git add -u
#add and commit at same time:
git add -A && git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"

#stage all but one file
git add -A
git reset -- main/dontcheckmein.txt


untracked files (if you get message of untracked files)
_________________
#add all files of the current directory to track (including untracked):
git add .
#then to commit all tracked files:
git commit -a


reset
_________________

#unstage everything
git reset

#Resets the index and working tree. 
Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded.

reset all local files to remote repo
_________________
#git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.
#Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master:
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
#if you’re working on a branch:
git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>

commit
——————————

#lock it into the repository:
git commit -m "commiting message"

#if using commit with long message:
git commit 

#To save your work and exit:
press Esc 
#then 
:wq 
#(w for write and q for quit).

#Alternatively, you could both save and exit by pressing 
Esc 
#then 
:x

pull
——————————————————

# get the latest changes:
# (go a git pull at the beginning of the day)
git pull

#if you want to pull exactly what’s on the server without doing a merge:
git fetch origin master
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD

fetch
__________________
#updates your remote tracking branch
#git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.



push to an existing repository
------------------------------------
git remote add origin https://github.com/benchung5/test1.git
git push -u origin master

branch
------------------------------------

#list branches
#The starred branch is your current branch:
git branch
to see all branches that exist:
git branch -a

#to switch to master branch:
git checkout master
#get latest
git pull

#whatever branch you’re on when you hit 
#git branch, it will create a copy of it and call it a new name
git branch <branchname>
#or to create a branch and switch to it
git checkout -b <branchname>

#switch to branch
git checkout <branchname>
#..work on files
#then commit and push
#(branch doesn’t exist on the remote until you push it)
git push origin <branchname>


#to delete a branch
git branch -D <branchname>

#download a branch and switch to it:
git checkout -b <branchname> <origin>


branch naming:

#not adding anything, just refactoring
refactor/feature
#just a little change to existing feature
fix/eglebegle
#unstable branch - only for code review
rfc/feature
#combine for nested branchs (using /refactor/ just adds semantics)
feature/eglebegle/refactor/xyzzy


merge

------------------------------------
#first fetch to include the remote branch in your local repo
git fetch
#to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use
git merge <branch-to-merge>
#manually by editing the files shown by git then after changing, you need to mark them as merged with
git add <filename>
#before merging changes, you can also preview them by using
git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>



replace local changes
------------------------------------
In case you did something wrong, which for sure never happens ;), you can replace local changes using the command
git checkout -- <filename>
this replaces the changes in your working tree with the last content in HEAD. Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.

If you instead want to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it like this
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master


stash
------------------------------------
#if you need to preserve local changes while getting latest remote update…

#push a new stash onto your stack
git stash

#list stashes
git stash list

#apply the first stash in stash list and then 
#immediately drop it from your stash list
git stash pop
#or you can get the name of the stash from git stash list
#but this doesn’t delete the stash
git stash apply <nameofstash>

#to apply a stash to a different branch
git stash
git checkout branch2
git stash pop

status
————————————

# shows us the difference between local files 
# and that of the remote repo
git status

#show diff for more specifics
git diff
#hightlight changes only
git diff --color-words

log
—————————

#list all commits
git log

#list commits only for a certain branch
git log mybranch --not $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname)' refs/heads/ | grep -v "refs/heads/mybranch")

#if accidentally hit commit and don't know how to get out of the screen it gives you, just do:
esc :wq

place it in your app dir and here is an example of the contents:
