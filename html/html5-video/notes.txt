Thats done with software. Download Handbrake. Under presets use "normal". And click web optimized. That will enable the movie to stream quickly and not have to download prior. In a nut shell that is it. Or you could watch 150 people on the web all say different versions of whats the best presets for optimized video in handbrake as I did.

Edit. Of course the size of your video matters too. Web streaming should prob not be any bigger than 720p.

And you could always make it very simple and just youtube or venimo embed the video. However I found video quality took a hit doing that.
