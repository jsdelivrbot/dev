install mac:
====================================================
-to see what options you can install:
brew options ffmpeg
-install while as admin user
brew install ffmpeg


notes:
====================================================

output doesn’t need a flag, if you don’t put in a flag, the command is considered output







converting video:
====================================================
input:
-i
codec:
-c
video:
v:
set bitrate for video to 1M 
-b:v 1M


example:
ffmpeg -i <input-video> -b:v 1000000 <output-video>
ffmpeg -i skater.webm -b:v 1000000 skater-out.webm



optimize mp4 files for the web:
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -movflags faststart -acodec copy -vcodec copy output.mp4

reduce the bitrate of the video - decrease the likelihood that the video player has to stop and buffer, and decreases the amount of data the video player has to process in realtime.
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b 1000000 -movflags faststart output.mp4

ffmpeg -i skater.mp4 -b 1000000 -movflags faststart skater-out.mp4

ffmpeg -i skater.mp4 -b 1000000 -vcodec libx264 skater-out.mp4



ffmpeg -i skater.mp4 -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -c:a libvorbis skater-output.webm


extracting video information:
====================================================

ffmpeg -i skater.webm


terms:
====================================================

Container: 
-is a file format
-streams are within containers
-examples: MP4, WebM, AVI

Streams:
-are media components(like video, audio, subtitles)
-Video - H.264, MPEG-2, WMV, VP8
-Audio - MP3, AAC, WMA

CODEC:
-streams are formatted/stored/encoded with codecs
-generally, any CODEC/stream can be within a container, but numerous exceptions

GOP:
-group of pictures
-full frame vs. differential frame
-lots of video doesn’t change significantly from frame to frame
-i-frame: full-frame (intra-frame). Independent of other frames
-{P,B,D}-frames: based on other frames
-larger GOP means smaller file sizes but seeking becomes difficult

process:
containers are demuxed into streams, streams are decoded into frames, filtered frames are encoded back into streams streams are mixed back into a container(file)
