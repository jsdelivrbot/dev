===========================================

first stop nginx:
systemctl stop nginx

renew with this command:
/opt/letsencrypt/certbot-auto renew

first stop nginx:
systemctl restart nginx

try this for better auto renew:

*note that for the above tutorial, in this step:
# Create the SSL certificate
./certbot-auto certonly --standalone

you should use
(backup nginx config files before using this)
./certbot-auto certonly --nginx
or —webroot --webroot-path /usr/share/nginx/html/artintheopen/
(see docs)

see info here:
https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#certbot-commands

The purpose of the —standalone option is to launch a temporary webserver because you don’t have one running.
But since nginx is installed you’d want it to use that when auto-renewing otherwize it will not let you renew.

******
actually… can run this command to stop then start nginx while renewing (if you’ve installed the cert using —standalone)
certbot renew --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start"
