                    <p>Chiropractic care focuses on restoring and maintaining the health of your joints, muscles and nerves through the use of an adjustment. Chiropractic Manipulative Therapy can restore normal range of motion, relieve pain and stimulate higher function of your brain and nervous system. 

                    <h3>Will the chiropractor give me a spinal adjustment on the first visit?</h3>
                    <p>Whether the patient receives an adjustment on the first visit is left to the discretion of the examining chiropractor. It depends on the examination findings and the patient's previous experience with chiropractic. There is always some form of treatment given if you are in severe pain.

                    <h3>What is the "cracking" noise I hear during an adjustment?</h3>
                    <p>When a chiropractor adjusts or physically moves a bone, a pressure difference is created within the synovial joint. Gases released cause an audible sound to be heard. The bones themselves are not breaking or cracking!

                    <h3>Does chiropractic care hurt?</h3>
                    <p>Yes and no. There may be some discomfort because of an injury to the joint and muscle. The injured area may feel sore after or during a treatment. The overall effect though, is to help you feel more relaxed and pain free!

                    <h3>Do I need a prescription or a referral from my medical doctor in order to see a chiropractor?</h3>
                    <p>No! And since chiropractic is a drugless practice, we do not prescribe either. Every Ontario resident is entitled to chiropractic care without a medical prescription.

                    <h3>How long will I need chiropractic care?</h3>
                    <p>The length of time you are under chiropractic care varies among individuals. The chiropractor will complete history, physical assessment, read your X-rays, at that point your diagnosis and Treatment Plan will be recommended to you.

                    <h3>How long do the adjustments take?</h3>
                    <p>The first visit lasts approximately 45 minutes. This allows time for the history taking and chiropractic examination. Each subsequent visit lasts approximately 10 - 15 minutes.
