                <h1>Massage Therapy</h1>

                <div id="page-content">

<p>Massage therapists employ a variety of hands-on techniques to assess and treat the soft tissues and joints of the body. Improved circulation of blood and lymph, decreased pain and inflammation, improved mobility, relaxation and stress reduction are all positive effects of therapeutic massage.

<h3>Does it hurt?</h3>
<p>Yes and no. There may be some discomfort because of an injury to the joint and muscle.  Inflamed and strained muscles may feel sore after or during and after a treatment. The overall effect though, is to help you feel more relaxed and pain free!

<h3>Are your therapists registered?</h3>
<p>All of our massage therapists are registered. They have a registration number which is included on the receipt that is submitted to your insurance company.

<h3>Do I have to be in pain to have a massage?</h3>
<p>No, massage therapy can be used for preventative care, relaxation and stress relief.</p>

<h3>Do I need a Doctor's prescription?</h3>
<p>Some insurance companies require a note from your physician with a diagnosis.</p>

<h3>How long does a massage last?</h3>
<p>We offer visits ranging from 30 minutes to 90 minute massages. </p>

<h3>If I am pregnant, can I still have a massage?</h3>
<p>Yes, with some pregnancies, women may suffer from lower back, neck pain, or sciatica. Massage can help relax the muscles that support the spine.</p>
