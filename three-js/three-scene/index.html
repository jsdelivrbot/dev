          <h3>Centrifugal force</h3>

          <h3>Angle</h3>
          <p>Skaters take off at a 40 degree angle and rotate with a slight backward tilt, which is essential to landing in balance. If they do the rotations perfectly vertically, they will come down on the heel of their 2.9mm blade.</p>

          <p>While running shoes have evolved considerably over the past two decades in providing cushioning and stability, the architecture of the skating boot has changed little in the past 100 years.</p>

          <p>The key to doing a quad is snapping the arms and legs into position as tightly and quickly as possible. An elbow, a head or a free leg that sticks out will slow down rotation.</p>
