nodemon: (stands for node monitor)
notice it has a cli folder in it's install. that means the it interacts with the command line
simply run:
nodemon app.js
and it will watch for any javascript changing in app.js and restart it so we don't
have to when we use it as a webserver.

install only as dev dependancy:
npm install nodemon --save-dev

to run nodemon: 
npm run dev
(script is located in the scripts area of package.json)
