tips on getting site more secure:
———————————————————
Some more tips to get your site more secure:

Upgrade unsecure requests (“HTTP” connections) to “HTTPS” redirecting users as needed. Take a look at Content Security Policy and upgrade-insecure-requests.

Update all links referencing “http://” to “https://”. If you rely on third-party scripts or content, talk to them about making their resources available over HTTPS too

Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers when serving pages. It’s a directive that forces browsers to only talk to your site in HTTPS.

I’d recommend watching Deploying HTTPS: The Green Lock and Beyond and Mythbusting HTTPS: Squashing security’s urban legends for more.
